My problem is due to MySQL 5.7 does not allow root user to access a database from client app. After switching to a normal user, problem solved.

Same here; problem with root access, after creating a new user and grant all necessary privileges and updated settings.php everything is good.



  
create user 'danc'@'%' identified by 'example';
grant all privileges on *.* to 'danc'@'%' with grant option;
flush privileges;
