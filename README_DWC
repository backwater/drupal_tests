Note !! When connecting a Drupal docker container to a mysql container, 

make sure that, when Drupal is asking you for the db location, and localhost is provided by default. 

but don't put localhost ! use the name of the db container ( in this case docker_drupal2_mysql_1 ) 



NOTE SOME HINTS ON THE ERROR: 

lock_may_be_available() (line 167 of C:\wamp\www\drupal7\includes\lock.inc).

My problem is due to MySQL 5.7 does not allow root user to access a database from client app. After switching to a normal user, problem solved.

Same here; problem with root

Same here; problem with root access, after creating a new user and grant all necessary privileges and updated settings.php everything is good.



  
create user 'danc'@'%' identified by 'example';
grant all privileges on *.* to 'danc'@'%' with grant option;
flush privileges;

So I did the above user creation to resolve the semaphore lock issue. Note that I also replaced my entire Drupal codebase with a new one.
Once I did that, everything started up fine, with no lock errors.


IF YOU'RE STILL STUCK ON THAT LOCK ERROR PAGE - RENAME SETTINGS.PHP FOLDER TO DEACTIVATE IT. THEN I THINK YOU HAVE TO START OVER, ie REBUILD WHOLE CONTAINER SYSTEM.

///// DOCKER-COMPOSE DOWN ISSUE: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35620997/how-to-make-volumes-permanent-with-docker-compose-v2 

Do not use docker-compose down ! It will delete containers. Use docker compose stop.

Not sure if this helps or not. When you use docker-compose up -d the container is downloaded and images created. To stop the docker images, use docker-compose down, and the images will remain and can be restarted with docker-compose start

I was using the up/down commands and kept losing my data until I tried the stop/start and now data persists.

After a couple of hours of searching this solved my problem! – mattsch Nov 2 '16 at 22:08

This is wrong. docker-compose down deletes volumes. I think that's what Bobby meant to say though. – Jonathan Stray May 23 '17 at 0:17

Stop/Start will keep the same containers, if you lose data from a down/up, then you are not storing your data in a volume, rather your data is in the container itself which should not be considered persistent. docker-compose down does not delete volumes unless you include the -v option too. – BMitch May 23 '17 at 1:38

The simplest solution is to use docker-compose stop instead of docker-compose down. And then docker-compose start to restart.


ccording to the docs, down "stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by up."

docker-compose down does not delete volumes unless you pass the -v option. – BMitch May 23 '17 at 1:36
That is not what I am seeing, with this docker-compose.yml file. Down definitely deletes the volume even without -v. If there is something I am doing wrong I would love to know! I live in fear of accidentally losing my database. – Jonathan Stray May 23 '17 at 18:27
